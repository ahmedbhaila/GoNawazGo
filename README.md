GoNawazGo
=========

A Tweet map showing who is tweeting #GoNawazGo around the world

If you are tweeting #GoNawazGo and you are that lucky 1%, I might be capturing your tweets and giving them a location on a google map. If you have enabled your location, I will use that to put that on the map. If you are using "other" fields to indicate your location I might not be capturing that yet :)

Things I used:
Spring Boot 
Twitter4j - for reading twitter streams
RabbitMQ - for processing tweets
RabbitMQ STOMP - for using the awesome sockets for realtime mapping
JSONPath - for 3rd party json response parsing

More awesomeness will be added with time
